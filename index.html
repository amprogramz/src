  <h2>What is Computer Science?</h2>

  <p> Computer Science is the study of computer software ahd how it interacts with 
    hardware. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Hardware limitations include:
    <div class="padding">
      <li>Storage Space</li>
      <li>Processing Power</li>
      <li>Graphics</li>
      <li>High Speed Networks</li>
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>

    Most modern day systems have plenty of reasources which makes this less of
    a daunting task. Legacy systems had alot more limitations as to what you could
    do with them, however, some of these systems still exist and are still supported.
    Even with newer systems, there will always be a better way to to manage software
    to make it less demanding of its hardware and to make it run almost seemlessly
    within its enviroment.
