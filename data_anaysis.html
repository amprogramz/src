        <h2>Questions:</h2>

        <div>
            <li>What was the most common password?</li>
            <li>How many passwords were present on both sites?</li>
            <li>3. What is the revised list of passwords and their combine repetitions, and how do they rank from most
                common to least?
            </li>
        </div>

        <h2>Description of data:</h2>
        <p>
            For my data sets I chose to analyze the 50 most common passwords between two websites, PHPbb and
            Singles.com. The data came from
            <br>

            <a href="https://blog.jimmyr.com/Password_analysis_of_databases_that_were_hacked_28_2009.php">
                https://blog.jimmyr.com/Password_analysis_of_databases_that_were_hacked_28_2009.php</a>
            <br>

            A more extensive list of passwords can be found at:
            <br>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists</a>
            <br>

            However, for simplicity, I chose to use a small set of data for the assignment. In order to get the data I
            ran into some difficulties finding a good data set that was in csv format, an my guess would be that the
            reason it is harder to find would be that this data is somewhat sensitive in nature. This website in
            particular mentioned that these were collected when the sites got hacked by hackers, and that these were
            only the most common ones. All of the data was in tables; however, no csv file was available for download,
            or I was unable to find one in the time I spent searching. So, I created by own csv format by copying the
            text into a text file, I used the bash command,
            <br>

            “cat ~/Documents/passSingles | sed 's/[[:blank:]]/,/g' | tee ~/Documents/passSingles.csv”
            <br>

            to convert it to a comma separated value format, and finally saved each one with a .csv file extension. .
            The ironic part was that after I finished my analysis, I read on google that they also accept a tab
            separated value list, which means that simply copying the text and leaving it as it was would have been
            sufficient to generate a spreadsheet.

        </p>

        <h2>Development process:</h2>
        <p>This conversion worked to import it into google docs, where I taught myself how to use their online
            spreadsheet tool. It was somewhat difficult at first to get started, because I have never used google docs
            before, only excel. The hardest part was figuring out how to open up two files in the same tab. Once I
            figured this out, the rest was pretty self-explanatory. I created a table where I joined the data from both
            tables. On this table I was able to do all of the calculations and sums to create pivot tables which present
            the conclusions. I first created a column that would detect if a password was present on both sites by
            sorting the password column, and comparing the password above and below the column. I then made another
            column that would total the total repetitions for both sites if both sites were present. I also created a
            column that would just list total repetitions if a password was uniqe to a site, else the number is 0. With
            this data I generated, I was able to answer the questions I formulated above about the data on pivot
            tables.</p>
        <h2>Findings:</h2>
        <p>Through this exercise I found that the most common password was 123456 in first place, and in second was
            password. My guess here is that a majority of people assume that using the simplest password may either be
            easy to remember, or that maybe it is more secure due to the fact that it is so obvious. I also found out
            that there were 13 out of 87 passwords that were common across both sites. This implies that these passwords
            are probably the best ones to avoid using, as they are most likely common across many sites and not only
            these sites in particular. You may have noticed that I mentioned that this was out of 87 passwords, and
            originally, I mentioned that there were two lists of 50 passwords which would imply that this is out of a
            hundred passwords? This is due to the fact that 13 of them were used on both sites, and since 87 = 100 – 13,
            that is why it is no longer out of a hundred. The last finding is the revised list of 87 passwords and their
            total repetitions totaled up from both sites, which can be observed in the graph I have generated.</p>

        <h2>Recommendations:</h2>
        <p>The first and most important recommendation that I would have is that if your password is present on this
            list, you should seriously consider changing it. Do not make the assumption that because your password is so
            simple, that it actually makes it more secure. This is a common misconception that many people have told me
            in their reasoning. The reason being is that these lists exist, and with a simple script, anyone could break
            your password in a matter of seconds if it exists on these lists. So, if you or anyone you know desire to
            keep your data secure, I strongly recommend creating a password of at least 10 characters using a
            combination of numbers, letters, and symbols to avoid falling victim to a hacker. It also never hurts to
            check if your password exists among one of these lists, and if it does, seriously, change it.</p><br>
