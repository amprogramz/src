    My name is Alec. I am a Computer Science Major. I currently have an 
    AAS in Computer Information Sciences with a Programming Foccus and a Minor in 
    Computer Networking, and i am working on a BS in Computer Sciences with a Math
    Minor. I currently work as a Software Engeneer for Dish Engineering. My Hobby is 
    Programming, I enjoy learning how to do things in a variaty of languages. My family
    is my real inspiration to learn more and I strive to do better for them. Computer 
    Science reminds me of the movie The Matrix, because when you put your mind to it 
    you can create anything. The thing to always remember when things get tough is to 
    never give up.</p>
