  <h1>Protocols</h1>
  <h2>Basics</h2>
  <p>
    Protocols are the things that make internet comunication possible. These define the ways
    we send data, and connect to other computers.
  </p>
  
  <h2>IPv4</h2>
  <p>
    This is the most common addressing that we use to link networks. Alot like houses, which have
    a physical address, computers use the IPv4 addressing scheme. These addresses are composed 
    of 4 8 bit numbers. Basically, these addresses range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, google 
    is 8.8.8.8 or 4.4.4.4 . The big delima was that we were going to run out of possible ip addresses
    which led to the creation of IPv6, however, this also led to the invention of private addressing
    within IPv4. This led to reserving the addresses for class A networks 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 
    with subnet mask 255.0.0.0, class B networks 172.16.0.0 - 172.36.255.255 with subnet mask 255.255.0.0,
    and class C networks 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 . The invention of 
    these addressing schemes allow us to create private networks, meaning that nobody is going to connect
    to these networks except for those internal to this network. This way we can now support thousands of 
    connections under 1 external IP address that connects to the world. So truly we havent ran out of IP 
    addresses yet, even though they are all owned.
  </p>
  <h2>IPv6</h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2>TCP Transmission Control Protocol</h2>
  <p>
    TCP is responsible for packing up data to send over the internet. It breaks down the data into packets 
    and packs them up with an ip address, and is responsible  for reassembling the data once it reaches its
    destination. 
  </p>
  <h2>DNS</h2>
  <p>
    DNS stands for the Domain Naming Service. This protocol is responsible for translating IP addresses into
    a readable name, like google.com wich is translated to 8.8.8.8. Domain names can be purchaced and sold,
    however, they can only be used once, so this has the potential to make them really valuable.
  </p>
  <h2>HTTP and HTTPS</h2>
  <p>
    HTTP stand for the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. This is used to . The "S" in HTTPS stands for "secure".
    This protocol uses encryption.
