<h1>Rasbery PI</h1>
<h2>Computational Artifact</h2>

<h2>Computing Innovation and Artifact Written Response</h2>
<p>
    My artifact gives a brief overview of what the Raspberry PI is and how it is an affordable PC board that can be your
    personal computer and much more. This artifact is intended to instruct others on the potential that one of these
    computers have. It may not look like much, and sounds like food, but it can do many things, including giving anyone
    a chance to learn how to program. The artifact allows people to see this and to understand what this little board is
    capable of. Never judge a book by its cover.
</p>
<h2>Artifact Development Process Written Response</h2>
<p>
    To create the artifact, I used Wondershare Filmora Screen Recorder, Power point, and my phone. I used Filmora to
    record the pictures, and edit the video, and to do a voice over the video. I will elaborate on the details more once
    I have actually created the artifact.

<h2>Effect of Innovation Written Response</h2>
<p>
    The Raspberry PI has led to many trends, such as the PI Top, which makes it affordable for anybody to get their
    hands on a computer to start programming for the low price of $35. There are many creative projects that a user can
    create like an Auto Etch-a-Sketch, Mini-Mars rover, Magic mirror, and even a 3D scanner. (Paul) It is also a cheap
    way for anyone to create a webserver with either one unit or a group of units called a “PI Cluster”. Oracle created
    the largest PI Cluster using 1060 Raspberry PI’s. (Tung) Raspberry PI also launched their official website for the
    PI 4 on a PI cluster for less than $1000. (Heath) This implies that the PI is an easy and affordable way for anyone
    to basically create what ever kind of project they desire within a tight budget.
    Inversely the Raspberry Pi has also become a tool for hackers. Since the computer is quite versatile it makes it
    easy to sneak around to make attacks on networks. There have been reports that hackers are attaching their PI to a
    drone, essentially turning them into an unmanned aerosol vehicle “UAV”, to fly it into where they plan on attacking.
    (Blog) The PI was also used to attack NASA in April 2018. (Humphries) This makes the PI a cheap tool that is capable
    of compromising large expensive systems as well.

<h2>Data Written Response</h2>
<p>
    The Raspberry PI can run on a variety of operating systems. These OS can be flashed onto an SD card, and are
    actually quite easy to exchange with other SD cards with different OS. This makes it easy to possess and run a
    variety of OS on the same board if desired. The PI can also support a USB keyboard and mouse, as input devices, and
    has an HDMI port, for your output device. (Mitchell) Since the PI can use a variety of OS, this makes it easy for a
    user to write and run code directly on the same device. It also has a variety of pins which can be used to create
    prototype devices and support both in/out. The capabilities that this device has are endless, and are only limited
    by the user’s imagination. (Mitchell) One of the downsides to a using a PI as a web server is that the user is
    responsible for securing the device, and if not properly configured, it could be easily hacked. Depending on how
    sensitive the data was on the server, this may not be the smartest approach to hosting a web server. After all, if
    we own the server, we are also responsible for the user’s data on that server.
