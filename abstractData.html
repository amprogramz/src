  <h1>Numbering Systems</h1>
  <h2>(Base 10) Decimal</h2>
  <p>
    Base 10 is our standard decimal numbering system. It is the numbering system that you are familiar with
    and probably use on a day to day basis. the base 10 numbering system contains 10 charecters, hint the 
    name base ten, which includes numbers 0-9. These then repeat themselve once it is done.
  </p>
  
  <h2>(Base 2) Binary</h2>
  <p>
    Base 2 is the numbering system more comonly refered to as binary. Notice the root word, bi, 
    which is the latin word for two. So as you may have guessed, this numbering system only
    contains 2 ch, 0 and 1. Basically this can be looked at as the electrical sates inside of a 
    computer, either they are on or off. We used this to tell the computer that something is 
    either true or false. Now, you may be asking how do we get the number 5 with 0 and 1, well
    that is actually quite simple. So each bit is one 1 or 0. 1 byte is composed of 8 bits. The
    value of a bit in this byte, starting from the right, is 1, and is multiplied by two each time 
    you progress to the left. So this makes it like this:
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    So knowing that this is the case, we know that our first byte has a maximum of 255 and a minimum
    value of 0. So lets say that we want do say the number 75, we could represent this by totaling
    up the bits that we set to true.
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/8054e39f-4be7-4727-bc4e-c1bdcf586881%2Fbinary3.png?v=1568078087025">
    <br>
    Therefor we now have the value of 75 in binary, but what if we wanted to do 175?
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    So this is simple, as long as you total the value of the bits that are true, you can read binary. 
    <br>
  </p>
  
  <h2>(Base 16) Hexidecimal</h2>
  <p>
    Hexidecimal is a numbering system that has a base of 16. As im sure you have already guessed,
    how can we get 16 charecters when we only have a total on 10 using our numbering system. This
    is true, but we also have an alphabet containing 26 charecters not including special charecters.
    This means that we could now technically have a numbering system of base36 if we wanted to,
    but befor we get to crazy, what does a base 16 numbering system look like.
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/8054e39f-4be7-4727-bc4e-c1bdcf586881%2FhexEx.png?v=1568073914105">
    
    <br>
    <br>
    Pretty crazy right. basically 0-15 or 0-F are used repeatedly to represent any number you want it
    to. The advantage to using hexidecimal is that you can represent larger values with less data.
