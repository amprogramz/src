    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        The event happened at the end of 2018 around Christmas and new year’s, and was not resolved until early 2019.
        7.6 million customers data were stolen and leaked.
        Blank Medias web site possessed back doors which allowed hackers to steal user’s information.
    </p>
    <h1>How and How to Prevent</h1>
    <p>
        The hackers were able to gain access to Blank Media Games servers due to vulnerabilities either in the server OS or
        the code itself. Once found it was super easy to exploit the system and get millions of customers data. One way that
        could have potentially prevented this attach from happening would have been to keep the server OS up to date with
        all of the latest updates and patches provided by the distribution. (Code.org, 2019) This alone helps to defend
        against known exploits as the creators usually provide patches as soon as possible after these attacks are known
        about. They could also make sure to patch their system in a timelier manner. This is because the article by Catalin
        also states that the breach had been known about for approximately two weeks. (Catlin, 2019) However, Blank Media
        Games must have been off on the holiday season for Christmas and New Years because nobody responded until after the
        1st of January.

    <h1>Data Specifics</h1>
    <p>
        The specific data that was stolen includes:
    <li>Usernames</li>
    <li>Email addresses</li>
    <li>Passwords in the (phpass, MD5(WordPress), MD5(phpBB3)) format</li>
    <li>IP addresses</li>
    <li>Game & forum activity</li>
    <li>Purchased game premium features, but without payment information or credit card details</li>
    (Catalin, 2019)
    </p>
    <h1>Data Privacy / Security / Storage Concern</h1>
    <p>
        Luckily the credit cards were handled by a third party, as a loss this information could have led to the end of
        Blank Media Games. However, passwords and usernames were still compromised. This is still bad because many users use
        the same passwords and usernames for every they do on the internet. (Code.org, 1019) This implies that millions of
        user’s data are at risk due to this breach. An email has been sent to all of its users to make sure to change their
        passwords to avoid getting any of their information stolen.
