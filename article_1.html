<h1>
    Blank Media Games 2019 7.6million affected
</h1>
<p>
    It was almost the holiday season; Blank Medias 8 employees were getting ready for the holiday season. They had been
    working hard all year long, but little did they know a threat was lurking around the corner. According to ZDNets
    reporter Catlin, Blank Media games was hacked right before the holiday season, and it would prove to be nightmarish
    threat.
    <br><br>
    Apparently, the data had been breached and it was reported to DeHashed, and DeHashed spent all of the holiday season
    from Christmas to New Years trying to notify Blank Media games of the incident. (Catalin, 2019) We all know that
    nobody wants to work over the holiday season, however, a company with 7.6 million customers has a responsibility to
    secure their data. Due to the company’s negligence to keep this data secure, they had lost the usernames, email
    addresses, passwords, IP Addresses, and various other pieces of data that were less significant. (Catalin, 2019)
    With these pieces of information floating around, these 7.6 million users are almost all put at risk. This is due to
    the fact that a majority of users all use the same username and password for all of their sensitive and user
    accounts. (Code.org, 1019)
    <br><br>
    The reason that these hackers were able to gain access to Blank Media Games servers was due to vulnerabilities
    either in the server OS or the code itself. Once found it would have been easy to exploit the system and get
    millions of customers data. (Kim, 2018) One way that could have potentially prevented this attack from happening
    would have been to keep the server OS up to date with all of the latest updates and patches provided by the
    distribution. (Code.org, 2019) This alone helps to defend against known exploits as the creators of the OS usually
    provide patches as soon as possible after these attacks are known about. They could also make sure to patch their
    system in a timelier manner, before going away to vacation, or even developed scripts to do this for them while
    leaving the server unattended. This way nobody has to be present to address this security concern.
    <br><br>
    A great source for learning more about security that I have found is the Hackers Playbook series by Peter Kim. This
    book goes over how to hack networks in order to teach users how to properly test their own servers and websites
    against a variety of attacks. The best way to defend against a hacker is to learn to think like a hacker. One of the
    first attacks he goes over, around page 17 – 20, is how to compile and deploy malware to a system over networks that
    allows you to gain full terminal access and bypass common AV security. (Kim, pg. 17-20, 2018) This is somewhat a
    more advanced attack that could be hard to prevent, however, most attacks that he explains in other books can be
    done by searching a system for exploits with Metasploit. Metasploit is a program that you can download from
    <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master">
        https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master
    </a>
    which makes it easy to search for known exploits on a
    server, which is also updated often. (Kim, pg. 7, 2018) This program does this and a lot more. He also mentions to
    also consider that there are a number of 0 day threats that nobody is aware of yet. So, taking this into
    consideration there are a lot more threats out there than simply phishing, social engineering, and outdated
    software, as mentioned on Code.org, but its not to deny the fact that this is a good start. (Code.org, 2019)
    <br><br>
    Luckily the Blank Media Games uses a third-party company to handle all of their customers credit cards and payment
    processing. If they would have had this sort of information on their server it could have caused the company to go
    bankrupt, due to all of the class action law suits that would follow. So, on their end, this was a great decision
    not to handle this sort of information, and this probably also saved their companies reputation. This may also be a
    good idea for any other companies considering handling payment information like this in the future. This is due to
    the fact that the use of a third party like PayPal to handle payment information prevents any liability on your own
    company when it comes to this sort of data getting stolen.
    <br><br>
    Upon checking Blank Media games website, I am only able to find news going back to February 3 of 2019, 3 months
    after the attacks happened. My guess is that they do not want to publicize this sort of information to the public.
    However, I was able to find out that they only have a staff of 8 people on their team. This is a lot of work for 8
    people to handle, and could possibly be part of the reason that their site was vulnerable to begin with. I am sure
    that they have learned their lesson and are doing more work into securing their data now that they had this massive
    breach of information. I guess the only unknown in this instance is truly to what extent they have gone to implement
    better security measures.
    <br><br>
    Blank Media Games, a small company, got hacked, and they managed to recover from this attack due to some good
    practices in not handling information that was too sensitive on their less secure servers. This should be looked at
    as good practice amongst any busyness because these 3rd party companies are focused on the security of this data
    alone, and less on anything else. This way you can focus on your own product, and less on securing high liability
    data that you should probably not even be aloud to have on your less secure server. Also, practicing the common
    security practices mentioned by code.org will prevent a majority of less serious attacks that could become serious.
    As far as Blank Media games is concerned, the data they lost was their fault, but they managed to alert their
    customers that their passwords were out. While they should have addressed the issue in a timelier manner, we should
    all be able to learn from their mistake in order to prevent these kinds of issues from happening in the future.
    Also, educating our end users is probably one of the strongest defenses in preventing cases like these from becoming
    a major issue. At some point you have to consider that it is truly their responsibility to keep their passwords
    different to defend themselves against attacks on any sensitive information that could get exposed in scenarios like
    this. The reality is that nobody’s computer is 100% secure, so if we at least inform our users of the issue, they
    can make an educated decision on how secure they want to make their own data.
